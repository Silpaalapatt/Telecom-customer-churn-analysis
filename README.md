# Telecom-customer-churn-analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn using various machine learning models. Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as it can significantly impact their business. This project aims to predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

Steps
1. Importing Libraries
In this step, we import the necessary Python libraries, including popular machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn, as well as data manipulation and visualization tools.

2. Importing Dataset
We load the telecom customer data, which includes relevant information about the customers and whether they have churned or not. This dataset is crucial for training and testing the machine learning models.

3. Data Visualization (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This includes summarizing statistics, data visualization, and identifying patterns and correlations in the data. EDA helps us understand the features and their relationships with the target variable (churn).

4. Feature Selection using Chi-Square Test
Chi-Square test is applied to select the most relevant features for predicting customer churn. Feature selection ensures that only the most influential variables are used in the machine learning models, improving efficiency and reducing overfitting.

5. ML Model Creation
Multiple machine learning models are created and trained using the selected features. The following classifiers are implemented:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
AdaBoost
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting
Each model is trained on the dataset and used to predict customer churn.

6. Performance Evaluation
The performance of each machine learning model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. This step allows us to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting customer churn.

The results and insights gained from this analysis can be invaluable for telecom companies looking to reduce customer churn and improve customer retention strategies. The machine learning models can assist in identifying at-risk customers and targeting interventions effectively.

Note: The code and Jupyter Notebook for this project are provided in this repository, along with the dataset used for analysis. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this work for your own customer churn analysis in the telecom industry.
